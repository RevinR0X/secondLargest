To find second largest number

Algorithm

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of elements in the array.
2. Create an empty array to store the elements.
3. Ask the user to input each element and store them in the array.
4. Set two variables, max and second_max, to the first and second element of the array.
5. Iterate through the array, starting from the third element.
6. If the current element is greater than the current value of max, set second_max to the current value of max, and max to the current element.
7. If the current element is greater than the current value of second_max but less than the current value of max, set second_max to the current element.
8. After iterating through the entire array, output the value of second_max as the second largest number in the array.
